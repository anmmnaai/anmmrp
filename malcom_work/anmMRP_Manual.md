## 4. Input production plan by product into anmMRP

    a. Review your demand forecast & build production plan
    b. Don't have demand forecast? make one based on your past selling record & your best judgement :)
    c. Demand plan needs to be built to match the time horizon & time slot of your production plan.
    b. Make steady state production input plan in a way to
        i. supply the demand without shortages
        ii. maintain the minimum inventory of product
        iii. maintain fixed time schedule per day in your facility
    c. Once production plan is complete, input the plan into anmMRP.

## 5. Review Material Requirement per your production plan

    a. You can see the list of BOM items & required quantities by the timeline of your production plan
    b. input the current inventory of each item at "Current inventory" (you can leave blank if there is none")
    c. The current inventory makes the "Days on hand" data, which enables material status monitoring againt the lead time of each material.

## 6. Review inventory shortage forecast with exploded view at MRP

    a. Once your production plan & BOM registration is complete, now you can review the inventory projection thru the planning horizon.
    b. Each item shows negative inventory as the production consumes all of the current inventory, and the level of negativeness increases.
    c. Instantly, you can see BBE-001 & LNA-002 will cause material shortages in Day-2 per current production plan
